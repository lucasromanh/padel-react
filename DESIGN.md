# Design System: Padel Club Management System
**Project ID:** 18165195955492391362

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
The design should feel **Premium, Action-Oriented, and Modern**. It uses a high-contrast dark theme by default, punctuated by vibrant accents that evoke the energy of a padel match. The interface is clean and professional, suitable for both high-stakes tournament management and casual player use.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
*   **Padel Neon (#B1FF26):** Primary action color. Used for main buttons, highlights, and active states. Evokes the classic padel ball color.
*   **Deep Court Charcoal (#121212):** Main background color. Provides a sleek, modern, and high-contrast base.
*   **Glass Surface (#1E1E1E with transparency):** Background for cards and containers.
*   **Stadium White (#FFFFFF):** Main text and prominent headings for maximum readability.
*   **Muted Steel (#94A3B8):** Secondary text and icon color.

## 3. Typography Rules
*   **Font Family:** `Inter`, `Hanken Grotesk` or `Space Grotesque`.
*   **Headers:** Bold, uppercase for main navigation and section titles to give a sporty, athletic feel.
*   **Body:** Clean, sans-serif with ample line height for readability.

## 4. Component Stylings (SHADCN-UI INSPIRED)
*   **Buttons:** Generously rounded (8px-12px). Primary buttons use the Neon Green with black text. Secondary buttons use a transparent background with a thin neon stroke.
*   **Cards/Containers:** Subtle "Glassmorphism" effect with a very fine (1px) border and soft shadows. Transitions should be smooth and subtle.
*   **Inputs:** High-contrast with a thin focus border in Neon Green.

## 5. Layout Principles
*   **Whitespace:** Ample breathing room to maintain a "prestige" feel.
*   **Grid:** Standard 12-column grid for desktop, single column for mobile.
*   **Responsiveness:** Elements should scale gracefully. Navigation switches to a sleek slide-out drawer on mobile.
